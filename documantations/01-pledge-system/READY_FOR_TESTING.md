## 💰 Financial Accounting Example

**Scenario:** Customer pledges gold items

```
INPUT:
  Customer: Ramesh (ID: 5)
  Items: 2 gold rings (150.5g gross, 145.2g net)
  Scheme: Gold (GLD, 2.5% monthly rate)
  Loan Request: ₹50,000

SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY:

1. Generates: Pledge No = GLD-2025-0001
2. Calculates: First Month Interest = ₹50,000 × 2.5% = ₹1,250
3. Records: Pledge with items in database
4. Creates 4 Ledger Entries:

   Entry 1: Items Received
   Debit:  Pledged Items (1040)      ₹75,000
   Credit: Cust Receivable (1051005) ₹75,000

   Entry 2: Loan Disbursed  
   Debit:  Cust Receivable (1051005) ₹50,000
   Credit: Cash (1000)                ₹50,000

   Entry 3: Interest Recorded
   Debit:  Cash (1000)                ₹1,250
   Credit: Interest Income (4000)     ₹1,250

   Entry 4: Running Balances Updated
   - Cash: Updated running balance
   - All accounts: Updated running balance

RESULT:
  ✅ Pledge created with unique ID
  ✅ 2 items tracked individually
  ✅ 4 ledger entries created
  ✅ All accounts updated
  ✅ Trial balance synchronized
  ✅ Financial statements accurate
```
