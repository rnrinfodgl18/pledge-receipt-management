## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✨ 1. Automatic Pledge Numbering
```
Format: {SCHEME_PREFIX}-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}
Example: GLD-2025-0001

✅ Scheme-based prefixes (Gold: GLD, Silver: SLV, etc.)
✅ Auto-incrementing per scheme per year
✅ Guaranteed unique
✅ Resets yearly
```

### ✨ 2. Automatic Ledger Integration ⭐⭐⭐
```
When pledge created → 4 ledger entries auto-created:

1. Dr: Pledged Items (1040)
   Cr: Customer Receivable (1051xxxx)
   → Records items are held by shop

2. Dr: Customer Receivable (1051xxxx)
   Cr: Cash (1000)
   → Records cash given to customer

3. Dr: Cash (1000)
   Cr: Interest Income (4000)
   → Records interest received

✅ Zero manual accounting needed!
✅ Running balance auto-calculated
✅ Trial balance auto-updated
```

### ✨ 3. Complete Data Tracking
```
✅ Pledge-level info (amounts, rates, dates)
✅ Item-level details (design, condition, stones)
✅ Weight tracking (gross, net)
✅ Photo evidence
✅ Audit trail (who created, when)
✅ Financial integration (auto-ledger)
```

### ✨ 4. Flexible Lifecycle Management
```
Active (created)
├── Redeemed (customer paid, got items)
├── Closed (extension/refinance)
└── Forfeited (unpaid, items kept)
```

### ✨ 5. Photo Management
```
✅ Upload multiple image formats
✅ Max 8MB per image
✅ Auto-cleanup on delete
✅ Organized storage
```

### ✨ 6. Smart Account Selection
```
✅ Payment account defaults to Cash
✅ Supports custom accounts
✅ Automatic customer receivable accounts
✅ All accounts validated
```

### ✨ 7. Full Authorization & Audit
```
✅ Per-company access control
✅ Admin override support
✅ User audit trail (created_by)
✅ Complete history tracking
```

## 📊 Financial Integration Example

**Scenario: Customer pledges gold items**

```
INPUT:
  Customer: Ramesh
  Items: 2 gold rings (150.5g gross, 145.2g net)
  Loan Request: ₹50,000
  Interest Rate: 2.5% per month

SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY:

1. Generates: Pledge No = GLD-2025-0001
2. Calculates: First Month Interest = ₹1,250
3. Creates: Pledge record with items
4. Creates: 4 Automatic Ledger Entries

   Entry 1: Dr 1040 ₹75,000 | Cr 1051005 ₹75,000
   Entry 2: Dr 1051005 ₹50,000 | Cr 1000 ₹50,000
   Entry 3: Dr 1000 ₹1,250 | Cr 4000 ₹1,250
   Entry 4: Running balances updated

RESULT:
  ✅ Pledge created
  ✅ 2 items tracked
  ✅ 4 ledger entries created
  ✅ All accounts updated
  ✅ Trial balance accurate
```
